# To Do List (Full-Stack) — React + Express + MongoDB + Gemini

This is a small but production-structured full‑stack application demonstrating:

- Authentication with JWT
- CRUD with pagination, filtering, sorting, and search
- Calculated fields
- React UI (login + expense management)
- Gemini integration for AI-assisted features
- Deployment configs (Render/Vercel)

See `docs/SETUP.md` to run locally and `docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md` for architecture decisions.
